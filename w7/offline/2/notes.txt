This is essentially sorting

6 5 4 3 2 1

getNextLightest essentially finds the insert order of a number, right?

Doing lightest and median
on three numbers gives us the
ordered subsequence of those three
numbers

1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 3 4 5 6
  X X   X

(Q = 4 so far)

Compare the mins of each sublist
and merge sort?

1 2 3 4 5 6
  X X X

1 4 6
2 3 5
