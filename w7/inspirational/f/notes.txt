Dijkstra from infected cities to everywhere:
O(M log M), should pass

Then, we can sort the nodes by decreasing distance, right?
We then add them one by one
Every time we add a node, we try to add its edges too

Idea for full points (woah!)
Construct the dual graph of the 
Okay nevermind the dual graph is very big
